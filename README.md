# Unlikely Pair

## About

A game set in a Fantasy based world where everyone wants to be a fighter or a great hero.  However, not everyone can be great…at least at fighting.

This game will center around two unlikely friends, The Fighter and The Healer.  In this game, you’ll focus on controlling the healer and making sure that your friend (bless his heart) doesn’t die.

It will be somewhat of an auto battler as you won’t be controlling the fighting or combat.  Instead you will be controlling the healing and making sure that the fighter has a full health bar in any situation.

### The Fighter

The Fighter has Heart!  The Fighter has Bravery!  The Fighter has Courage!  The Fighter… is kind of bad at fighting.  The Fighter has never known fear because his best friend The Healer has always kept him from getting too badly injured.

### The Healer

The Healer has discovered that he doesn’t need to be tough in this world of other macho fighters.  The Healer can do just as much dungeon looting as the next fighter.  As long as they go with their best friend, The Fighter.



## Why Make This?

I just wanted to make something that I know I could do fairly quickly in order to learn.  It’s also something that could be easily scalable if I ever wanted to take it further in the future.



## What I hope to Learn

I want to use this project to learn how to construct my projects and what seems to work the best in terms of setup.  What I could use as components for use over and over again.

I also want to learn interesting mechanics, like the healing one I have planned for this game.  It will teach me how I’d like to approach a combo system for future games.

Simple animations.  I want to learn some simple animations in Godot and how to bring in animations from outside sources like animation sprite sheets.

How to add sound effects and music.  I want to create simple sounds and some very basic music.

How to use Signals in Godot.  I don’t understand these concepts at all, and would like to understand them much better

How to link scenes from one another.  This also seems like a foreign concept to me at the moment and I would like to get more comfortable knowing how to use one file/scene in others, but also keeping them separate from one another
